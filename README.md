# Polygon Intersection

## Description

This project provides a Python library implementing a polygon intersection algorithm
using Doubly Connected Edge Lists.

The repo also contains a Flask server exposing the library functions,
a React-based web interface, and an offline GUI in Python.

## Running

The back end server and the front end can be run with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Assuming Docker and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
are installed, you can run the app with:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The app can be stopped using:

```sh
$ docker-compose down
```
