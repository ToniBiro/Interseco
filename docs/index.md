## About the application

### Description

This software covers two possible applications.

Firstly, this project provides a Python library implementing a polygon intersection algorithm using Doubly Connected Edge Lists.
This library can be used in the development of other projects.

Secondly, it is designed to be an educational tool for teaching the fundaments of geometry. In order to display the functionality of the program, the repo contains a Flask server exposing the library functions. It is also equipped with a friendly user interface in order to be easy to use and address the needs of our targeted audience. It uses a React-based web interface and an offline GUI in Python.

### Marketing perspective

A picture is worth 1000 words. This is statement is especially true when it comes to learning geometry.
Teaching geometry without a visual aid is a very bad idea and unnecessary given the advancement of technology in the past 20 years.

Not being able to comprehend the visual part of geometry results most of the time in the development of a negative attitude towards the subject and frustration, and so, because of this, a lot of children and even grownups miss out on understanding a lot of things quite easy to understand and beautiful if provided with the right perspective.

The scope of this application is to help students learn and teachers teach in a more efficient and attractive way an important part of geometry, intersections.

This piece of software is designed for people of all ages but our targeted audience is mainly middle school/high school students.

### The beginning

We started working on the app as our final project for the Computational Geometry class.

Most of the concepts applied in the code of the app we learned from that class, also understanding how important visualization is for this field of study.

This can be extended to any part of geometry, so we chose to create something that eases the understanding of polygon intersection seeing what an important role it has as a building foundation to further grasp more complex concepts.
